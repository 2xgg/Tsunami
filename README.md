A CraftBukkit CB1060 fork for Beta 1.7.3 fixing bugs and adding basic features

## Licensing
Craft Bukkit and Bukkit are licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0

Any future commits to this repository will remain under the same GNU General Public License v3.0

Libraries in the compiled .jar files distrusted may contain their own licenses

## How To Setup And Compile - IntelliJ IDEA
1. Clone this project using Git Bash or a desktop client.
2. Open IntelliJ and create a new project in the same directory as the Project Poseidon src folder.
3. Download or create a libraries jar as shown in the section How to get a libraries jar
4. Add the downloaded libraries jar as a library
5. Create a artifact in Project Structure including the dependency
6. Build artifact. You should now have a runnable JAR


## How to get a libraries jar
You can either download the libraries jar or extract it manually from a CB1060-CB1092 jar.

* You can download the libraries jar from the following method: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qs110g2juivinp8/CraftBukkit-b1.7.3-libs.jar?dl=1
* You can remove Bukkit, Craftbukkit and MC-DEV files from an existing CB1060-CB1092 jar. This jar should then only contain the libraries of Craft Bukkit
